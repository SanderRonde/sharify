# Sharify
Matchmaking system for multiple Spotify users to create a list which has songs based on similar interests

## Running

* Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) or better yet [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* Run `npm install` when using `nodejs` or `yarn` when using `yarn`
* For production mode run `npm run prod`
* It should now be running on port 1234 by default

### Developing

* Either run `npm run dev` to run it all in one terminal or:
	* Run `npm run frontend` in one terminal for the frontend (yes it's very slow to start).
	* Run `npm run backend-dev` in another one for the backend. 
	* Run `npm run backend-watch` to compile files in the backend when they change.
* That's it, the server is available on port 3000 and will restart when you make any changes on either the frontend or the backend
