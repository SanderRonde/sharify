# Sharify
Matchmaking system for multiple Spotify users to create a list which has songs based on similar interests

## Running

* Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) or better yet [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* Run `npm install` when using `nodejs` or `yarn` when using `yarn`
* Run `npm run compile`
* Run `npm run start` to start it or `npm run dev` to start it in development mode
* It should now be running on port 1234 by default

### Developing

* To compile any files on change, start the typescript compiler, to do this run `npm run watch:server` and `npm run watch:client` in two console windows in the background.
* That's it, the server is available on port 1234 and will restart when you make any changes
